# Tipgrowthtoymodel
Matlab/Octave code for toy model of oscillatory pollen tube growth. 

Pollen tubes are tip growing plant cells that display oscillatory growth behavior.
It has been demonstrated experimentally that the reduction of the average pollen tube growth
rate through elevated extracellular calcium or borate concentrations coincides with a greater
amplitude of the growth rate oscillation and a lower oscillation frequency. We present a simple
numerical model of pollen tube growth that reproduces these results, as well as analytical calcu-
lations that suggest an underlying mechanism. These data show that the pollen tube oscillator
is non-isochronous, and is different from harmonic oscillation.
